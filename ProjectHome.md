When the inital team is formed we will create an Irc channel to
discuss the project in realtime and hold weekly meetings to discuss
the current development, what needs to be done and choices
regarding the future developments and idea's for the game itself.
Everyone who wants to participate is weclome to, whether they contribute
Game ideas, storyline ideas, contribute art, or help in coding the game.

--Remember you only need to contribute as much as you feel you want to,
If you want to be a full time member, contribute now and then, or just voice
your idea's for the game then that is up to you to decide, every little helps!--

I also believe that advertising the project and having banners and making it eye catching is vital to spreading the project and getting noticed. Help in this area is also appreciated.

This was a rough demo we made testing out mining and 2d gameplay to see how we
might progress in the near future, maybe expanding into 2d MMORPG.
Feel free to download and play it yourself.
